# Test Driving Learning Project

## Introduction
During week 3 of the Makers Academy bootcamp I was given 3 simple programs to test drive:
- A class that stores the title and contents of a text
- A class that tests and stores texts for correct grammar (starting with a capital letter and ending with a fullstop)
- As a user, so that I can keep track of my tasks, I want a program that I can add todo tasks to and see a list of them. As a user, so that I can focus on tasks to complete, I want to mark tasks as complete and have them disappear from the list.

These were exciting tasks, and I was still fairly new to OOP programming. For each of these programs I followed this structure of development:
1. Write the recipe
2. Write a test
3. Write the code to pass that test
4. Write the next test
5. Write the code to pass that test
6. And so on
